# Visualization-of-Data-Structures
A tool that can be used as an effective supplement to the traditional classroom education, in which students can learn through experimentation. 

# Introduction

The best way to understand data structures in to see them in action. Commonly, data structures are learned by implementing them in 'C'. Pointers in 'C' create another hurdle in learning. This tool takes body of main method in 'C' as the input, does computations on it and finally creates animation of respective data structures.
